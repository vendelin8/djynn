/** The algorithm is inspired by mersenne twister, but differs in some ways. It is designed
 * to be fast, before generating perfect randomness, though the entropy values measured are
 * relatively good.
 * 
 * From the seed is generated a sequence of 256 integer numbers with a decent randomness and
 * place in the table. For generation of new random numbers are used two more variables; "num"
 * and "index". "Index" is an unsigned integer of the uint64_t-type that counts forward +1 for
 * every generated number. This ensures we avoid getting stuck in loops. "Num" is also an
 * unsigned integer of type uint64_t, it is always the value of the previously generated number.
 * When generating a new number we take two numbers in the table, add num to the second
 * number and xor them together. The result is placed in the address of the first number.
 * The code for this algorithm looks like this:
 * @code
table[index&0xff] ^= table[num&0xff] + num;
num = table[index&0xff];
index = index +1;
 * @endcode
 * It isn't more complicated than this, and yet it generates quite a good result compared to other
 * random number generators. A comparsion can be made here:
 * http://www.cacert.at/cgi-bin/rngresults
 * 
 * Actually, given a sufficently great enough amount of random data it seems to top the list,
 * but even a smaller amount of data places random at a good spot.
 * 
 * To ge a random number, simply call any of the given methods, depending on what type of value
 * you require. The most commonly used method is perhaps uint32(), that generates an unsigned
 * 32 bits integer. There are some methods specific for games, board games or role-playing games.
 * 
 * Here is one example of how to get a random int:
 * @code
random *r = q_rnd_new();
int i = q_rnd_int32(r);
q_rnd_free(r);
 * @endcode
 * 
 * Here's an example on how to store and restore an instance of Random:
 * @code
random *r = q_rnd_new();
FILE *fp = fopen("random.dat","wb");
q_rnd_write(fp);
fclose(fp);

... // Do romething with r.

fp = fopen("random.dat","rb");
q_rnd_read(fp,r); // Reads r to be exactly the same as when saved.
fclose(fp);
q_rnd_free(r);
 * @endcode
